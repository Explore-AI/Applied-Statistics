# 1. Regression and Other Stories

By popular vote - the first book on our study list is Andrew Gelman's [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/). The book is less theory-focused, and more aimed at using regression to solve real-world problems, making it an ideal starting point for the group. The examples and labs contained within are written in R, giving us a nice oppurtunity to translate the work into Python so that it may reach a wider audience.
